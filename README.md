**Extra Info**

The folder called dataset contains all the data that will be used for this project. The train folder contains all the training data and the test folder contains all the test data. Each folder label represents a different class. In total, we have 4 different classes which are neutral, surprise, focused/engaged and angry.

**Dataset Link**

The dataset used for most classes except for engaged/focused was FER-2013: <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013">Dataset link here</a>

<br>**Instruction to run code:**
The class distribution will show a bar graph of the number of images in each class and will display the number of image count in the Python terminal/ If the data path is set to Dataser\\train it will do the training data but if it is set to Dataset\\test it will display the test amount.

The sampleimage.py will provide you with a 5x5 grid with random images from each class and the histogram for each of the images. The set will be displayed 1 by 1. The first will be the 5x5 image grid then when you close the grid the histogram graphs for that set will be displayed. This will continue until all the label datasets been displayed. Only 1 graph set will be displayed until you close the window. Ensure the data path is set to Dataset\\train and then you just need to run the Python code for it to work.
